Hello! I am Thomas Capelle (cape), Machine Learning engineer at [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/capecape) working on the AI Applied Team. I am responsible for keeping the [wandb/examples](https://github.com/wandb/examples) repository live and up to date. I also build content on ML-OPS, application of `wandb` to industry and fun deep learning in general. Previously I was using deep learning to solve short term forecasting for solar energy at [Steady Sun](https://steadysun.fr). I have a background in Urban Planning, Combinatorial Optimization, Transportation Economics and Applied Math.

I love contributing to OSS and the ML community!
