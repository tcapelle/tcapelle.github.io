I am Ml engineer at [SteadySun](https://www.steady-sun.com/). I am interested on ML/DL in general, active contributor to the fastai library.
Currently, I have been exploring on model serving and deploying, and the various details that may make your model crash or perform poorly.

For more info and my detailed CV, you can check my minimal website [here](https://tcapelle.github.io/)
