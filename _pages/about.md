I am Ml engineer at [SteadySun](https://www.steady-sun.com/). I am interested on ML/DL in general, active contributor to the [fastai community](https://forums.fast.ai/u/tcapelle/summary).
Currently, I have been exploring on model serving and deploying, and the various details that may make your model crash or perform poorly.
